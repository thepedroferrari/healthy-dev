##  Casein
Casein is a slow-digesting dairy protein that people often take as a supplement. It releases amino acids slowly, so people often take it before bed to help with recovery and reduce muscle breakdown while they sleep.

##  Glutamine
Glutamine is an important amino acid with many functions in the body. It is a building block of protein and critical part of the immune system. What's more, glutamine has a special role in intestinal health. Your body naturally produces this amino acid, and it is also found in many foods.

##  BCAAS
The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are a group of three essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They are essential, meaning they can't be produced by your body and must be obtained from food. BCAA supplements have been shown to build muscle, decrease muscle fatigue and alleviate muscle soreness.

##  Creatine
Creatine is most commonly used for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass in athletes and older adults. There is some science supporting the use of creatine in improving the athletic performance of young, healthy people during brief high-intensity activity such as sprinting.

##  Whey Protein
People commonly use whey as supplementation, alongside resistance exercise, to help improve muscle protein synthesis and promote the growth of lean muscle mass. ... Whey protein is considered a complete protein as it contains all 9 essential amino acids. It is low in lactose content.

##  Arginine
Nitric oxide is a powerful neurotransmitter that helps blood vessels relax and also improves circulation. Some evidence shows that arginine may help improve blood flow in the arteries of the heart. That may improve symptoms of clogged arteries, chest pain or angina, and coronary artery disease.

##  Niacin
Niacin (nicotinic acid) is a B vitamin (vitamin B3). It is correct that niacin is used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. It is also used to lower the risk of heart attack in people with high cholesterol who have already had a heart attack.

##  Vitamin B6
Vitamin B6, along with the other B vitamins, helps the body turn food into energy. On its own, vitamin B6 has many other uses that are important to maintaining a healthy body and developing a healthy brain. Vitamin B6 is so important it may have triggered the growth of the first living creatures on Earth.

##  Folic acid
Folic acid helps your body produce and maintain new cells, and also helps prevent changes to DNA that may lead to cancer. As a medication, folic acid is used to treat folic acid deficiency and certain types of anemia (lack of red blood cells) caused by folic acid deficiency.

##  Pantothenic Acid
Vitamin B5, also called pantothenic acid, is one of the most important vitamins for human life. It's necessary for making blood cells, and it helps you convert the food you eat into energy. Vitamin B5 is one of eight B vitamins. All B vitamins help you convert the protein, carbohydrates, and fats you eat into energy.

##  Potassium
It is an electrolyte that counteracts the effects of sodium, helping to maintain consistent blood pressure. Potassium is also important for maintaining the balance of acids and bases in the body. Bases are alkalis that have not yet dissolved in water.

##  Chloride
Chloride is one of the most important electrolytes in the blood. It helps keep the amount of fluid inside and outside of your cells in balance. It also helps maintain proper blood volume, blood pressure, and pH of your body fluids.

##  Calcium
calcium is key for the health of your bones and teeth, but it also affects your muscles, hormones, nerve function, and ability to form blood clots. Plus, research has suggested—although not yet confirmed—that calcium may help other problems like PMS, high blood pressure, and possibly weight gain.

##  Phosphorus
Phosphorus works with calcium to help build bones. You need the right amount of both calcium and phosphorus for bone health. Phosphorus also plays an important structural role in nucleic acids and cell membranes. And it's involved in the body's energy production.

##  Iron
Iron is an important component of hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to transport it throughout your body. Hemoglobin represents about two-thirds of the body's iron. If you don't have enough iron, your body can't make enough healthy oxygen-carrying red blood cells.

##  Copper
Copper is an essential nutrient for the body. Together with iron, it enables the body to form red blood cells. It helps maintain healthy bones, blood vessels, nerves, and immune function, and it contributes to iron absorption. Sufficient copper in the diet may help prevent cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, too.

##  Manganese
Manganese is important in connective tissues, in the formation of bones and blood-clotting factors, and is also involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption and blood sugar regulation.

##  Selenium
Selenium is a mineral that is found in soil and occurs naturally in certain foods (such as whole grains, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, and seafood). Selenium is not produced in the body, but it is needed for proper thyroid and immune system function.

##  Molybdenum
Molybdenum is an essential mineral found in high concentrations in legumes, grains and organ meats. It activates enzymes that help break down harmful sulfites and prevent toxins from building up in the body.

##  Biotin

Proponents claim that these enzymes can help treat a variety of health problems, such as digestive disorders. Secreted by the pancreas, digestive enzymes aid the body in breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.

##  Magnesium
Magnesium is a nutrient that the body needs to stay healthy. Magnesium is important for many processes in the body, including regulating muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, DNA, and the transmission of electrical signals in the body. Adequate magnesium intake has been associated with a lower risk of: atherosclerosis, a fatty buildup on the walls of arteries. hypertension, or high blood pressure

##  Zinc
Zinc is needed for the proper growth and maintenance of the human body. It is found in several systems and biological reactions, and it is needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more.

##  Carnitine
L-carnitine is an amino acid that performs three very important functions that enhance athletic performance: L-carnitine is THE nutrient, the "ferry" so to speak, that shuttles fatty acids from the blood into the mitochondria, the energy-producing "furnaces" in the cells, so that the fatty acids can be used as energy.

##  5-HTP
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an amino acid that your body naturally produces. Your body uses it to produce serotonin, a chemical messenger that sends signals between your nerve cells. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, weight gain and other health problems (1, 2).

##  CLA
