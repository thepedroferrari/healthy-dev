##  Free Radicals
Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaired electrons. Electrons like to be in pairs, so these atoms, called free radicals, scavenge the body to seek out other electrons so they can become a pair. This causes damage to cells, proteins, and DNA

##  Antioxidants
Scientists believe molecules called free radicals can contribute to the aging process. They also may play a part in diseases, like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Antioxidants are chemicals that help stop or limit the damage caused by free radicals. Your body uses antioxidants to balance free radicals.
