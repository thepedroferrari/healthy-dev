##  Free Radicals
Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaired electrons. Electrons like to be in pairs, so these atoms, called free radicals, scavenge the body to seek out other electrons so they can become a pair. This causes damage to cells, proteins, and DNA

##  Antioxidants
Scientists believe molecules called free radicals can contribute to the aging process. They also may play a part in diseases, like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Antioxidants are chemicals that help stop or limit the damage caused by free radicals. Your body uses antioxidants to balance free radicals.

# Elements

##  Vitamin A

##  Calcium
calcium is key for the health of your bones and teeth, but it also affects your muscles, hormones, nerve function, and ability to form blood clots. Plus, research has suggested—although not yet confirmed—that calcium may help other problems like PMS, high blood pressure, and possibly weight gain.

##  Phosphorus
Phosphorus works with calcium to help build bones. You need the right amount of both calcium and phosphorus for bone health. Phosphorus also plays an important structural role in nucleic acids and cell membranes. And it's involved in the body's energy production.

##  Iron
Iron is an important component of hemoglobin, the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to transport it throughout your body. Hemoglobin represents about two-thirds of the body's iron. If you don't have enough iron, your body can't make enough healthy oxygen-carrying red blood cells.

##  Copper
Copper is an essential nutrient for the body. Together with iron, it enables the body to form red blood cells. It helps maintain healthy bones, blood vessels, nerves, and immune function, and it contributes to iron absorption. Sufficient copper in the diet may help prevent cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, too.

##  Magnesium
Magnesium is a nutrient that the body needs to stay healthy. Magnesium is important for many processes in the body, including regulating muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, DNA, and the transmission of electrical signals in the body. Adequate magnesium intake has been associated with a lower risk of: atherosclerosis, a fatty buildup on the walls of arteries. hypertension, or high blood pressure

##  Zinc
Zinc is needed for the proper growth and maintenance of the human body. It is found in several systems and biological reactions, and it is needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more.

##  Carnitine
L-carnitine is an amino acid that performs three very important functions that enhance athletic performance: L-carnitine is THE nutrient, the "ferry" so to speak, that shuttles fatty acids from the blood into the mitochondria, the energy-producing "furnaces" in the cells, so that the fatty acids can be used as energy.

##  5-HTP
5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an amino acid that your body naturally produces. Your body uses it to produce serotonin, a chemical messenger that sends signals between your nerve cells. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, weight gain and other health problems (1, 2).
